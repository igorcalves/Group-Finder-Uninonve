## About the project 
This project will help you find your ideal university group. It helps you create and administer your group with a simple web page.

When you create an account, you can create a group. However, if you don't want to create an account, you can also join a group.

This project aims to be at zero cost; for this, we decided to use only free resources like Firebase and GitHub Pages.
